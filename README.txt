HOW IT WORKS
        Two programs are contained in this repository i.e. Mean Filter and Median Filter. 
        Each program has a serial and parallel implementation which are later compared for performance.
        
        MEAN FILTER
                The Mean filter uses a arithmetic mean/average calculation on 
                neighbouring pixels in an image to smooth/blur the pixel or image
                that is being manipulated.
                
        MEDIAN FILTER
                The Median filter uses a median calculation on
                neighbouring pixels in an image to remove noise from a pixel
                or image that is being manipulated.
       
PROGRAMS CONTAINED IN THIS REPOSITORY
        1. Serial Mean Filter
        2. Parallel Mean Filter
        3. Serial Median Filter
        4. Parallel Median Filter

STEPS TO RUN A FILTER
        STEP 1: Add a picture to the pics directory
        STEP 2: Change the filepath in the clearly marked section of the java program file stored in the src directory
        STEP 3: In the Assignment1 directory, type 'make' to compile all programs
        STEP 4: Go to the bin directory
        STEP 5: Run 'java <name of program without extention> <input filename(NOT PATH)> <output filename(NOT PATH)> <filter window size>' to execute the program
        STEP 6: Find the output picture in the pics directory
